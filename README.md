S -- Substitute

What have we to replace so that we can do less harm but still maintain utility?

Alternate interminable scrolling - conscious sessions.
Substitute endless feeds with time-constrained, purposeful sessions (e.g. "Study 25 minutes" or "Relax 15 minutes).

Wireless replacement screen use - low-stimulation modes
Switch on the grayscale mode, audio-only mode, text mode to lower the rate of sleep impairment on bright and interactive interfaces at night.

Replace fixed notifications - check-in batches.
Notifications are not delivered immediately, but in groups at predetermined times, which reduces stress and distraction levels.

Persona Alignment:
Harried-Out Overachiever, Late-Night Gamer, Digitally Unaware Study.

C -- Combine

What are some of the things that can be bundled to give value?

Screen-time tracking + mental health reflection.
